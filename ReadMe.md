# HandSignRecognizer 👌👍👎✌️✋

The goal of this project is to create an AI that can predict what hand gesture the user is doing on his webcam.

I have planned to recognize following signs:
- Ok 👌
- Good 👍
- Bad 👎
- Victory, V ✌️
- Hand ✋

## Step to run

The program works three steps:

- **1.** You need to record training data by running the capture.py script. Be sure to create needed folders:
  - data/ok
  - data/good
  - data/bad
  - data/v
  - data/hand
  - data/none
- **2.** Train the model by running train.py
